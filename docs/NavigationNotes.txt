Navigation in Selenium
We have 2 methods to reach desirable webpage:
.get(url);
.navigate().to(url);
Difference:
In 90% cases they do the same thing, but technically they are different.

navigate() vs get():

 .get() method:
 - simple and readable
 - opens the specified url and waits until page is fully loaded before proceeding with rest of code execution.
 - clears the history
 - best for test start

 .navigate().to() method:
 -part of navigation API, connection to .back(), forward() and refresh();
 -works with the history stack ( able to move back and forward between pages if such sequence occurred)
 -good for testing history
 -navigate().back() - moves to the previous page
 navigate().forward() - moves to one page ahead
 navigate().refresh() - refershes the page
 (notice: navigate().back() / forward() / referesh() works only if history stack present)


When .refresh() method is required:
 -date is changed on webpage(status or table update)
 -session logout or reset( UI freezes and is not rebuilding)
 -stale UI (page looks loaded but DOM is old)
When it's a bad idea to use .refresh():
 -element is not clickable
 -element wasn't found
 -etc
